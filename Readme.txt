Slots game, by Daniel Ramírez

This game was made with the Phaser game framework and tested on Google Chrome.
It should be run from a Web server, either local or remote.
The Fixed Mode section was made in plain HTML.

In order to activate Fixed Mode, click on the "Fixed Mode" button.
While Fixed Mode is deactivated, the options selected will be ignored by the game.

The additional assets were made in Photoshop.
